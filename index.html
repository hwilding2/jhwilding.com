    <h3>how we met</h3>
    <p>Jonathan and I met in June of 2018 at BYU. Our dorms were adjacent and we attended the same ward. At the very beginning of summer term, I was enrolled in a intermediate ballroom dance class and it became clear that we were severely lacking boys. Our instructor made it clear that a couples class without couples would have to be dissolved if we weren't able to recruit more boys. Determined to keep the class, I knocked doors in the boys' dorm, eventually recruiting Jonathan and a few other boys. From the beginning, I was drawn to Jonathan's easy humor, outgoing personality, and drive. We walked to and from class together every day. After two weeks, we'd become fast friends. Jonathan finally asked me out on a date to the bell tower, where we practiced dancing, visited the Museum of Art, and talked for hours. We clicked!</p>
    <p>The rest is history. We dated for four months before Jonathan proposed on October 25th, 2018, at the very same bell tower where we had that first date. He gave me a Moleskin journal, in which he'd written a love letter to me. He asked if I'd write the rest of the story with him. He got down on one knee, and asked if I'd marry him. I said yes! Three months later, on January 3rd, 2019, Jonathan and I were sealed together in the Provo City Center temple. Then, the real story began.</p>

    <h3>the first year</h3>
    <p>2019 was a year of love, learning, and growth for both of us. We spent a brief honeymoon in downtown Salt Lake City directly after we were married, and celebrated again in May with a Disney/California coast trip. Jonathan discovered his passion for math and switched his major to Applied Math. I got an internship with BYU-Pathway Worldwide as an executive office assistant. I worked through the prerequisites for the business school while determining what to study. In the fall, I took an introductory business programming class and set my sights on Information Systems.</p>
    <p>For most of the year, we tried to get pregnant, unsuccessfully. In October, we made a plan with our practitioner and on December 28th, 2019, we found out we were expecting. At the same time, we chose to move from our first apartment to an apartment in Wymount. Jonathan and I celebrated, knowing that our family of two would soon be a family of three.</p>

    <h3>the second year</h3>
    <p>2020 brought with it a global pandemic, two more moves, and a baby girl! We spent our anniversary in downtown Sacramento, visiting Jonathan's sister, her husband, and his family. In March, BYU went online to prevent the spread of COVID-19, a highly contagious virus that swept the world. We moved to Oregon to live with my family, while we finished up classes. With internships cancelled, tensions ran high as we tried to prepare our lives emotionally, socially, and financially for a baby. We moved back into Wymount at the beginning of July, when I was seven months pregnant and received news that I'd been accepted into the Information Systems program. Two months later, on August 22nd, 2020, we welcomed Harper Rose Wilding into our family. She was born at 4:47am, at 19 1/2 inches and 6lbs, 7oz.</p>
    <p>Starting the junior core with a ten-day-old a baby meant lots of prayers of gratitude for recorded lectures, working from home, and a baby who sleeps relatively well. Being parents to Harper brought Jonathan and I together in a way no other challenge had. We mutually sacrificed to take care of her and help her to grow. In return, she blessed our lives with a sense of eternity and an appreciation for small wins. We spent Thanksgiving with my grandparents in Arizona, then spent the month of December and Christmas holidays with Jonathan's family in NY. Harper learned to smile, sleep through the night, and appreciate toys.</p>

      <h3>the third year</h3>
      <p>2021 has been a year of celebration so far. We celebrated our second anniversary at Maverick's with fine dining and flowers. Jonathan graduated on April 22nd, 2021 with his bachelor's degree in Mathematics. Harper learned to crawl, eat solid foods, and wave hello. We spent more time outside and with our ward as the pandemic began to ease up. Jonathan and I both got vaccinated and spent some time visiting with friends and family. Jonathan surprised me for my birthday with a romantic getaway to downtown Portland, where he treated me like a queen. Harper turned one and got to celebrate with my family on a trip to Seattle, as well as with her friends a week later here in Utah. In a sad, but miraculous, set of events, both of Jonathan's grandmothers, Granny Christie and Grandma Mary Lou, passed away within days of each other. We got to attend both of their funerals, one in New York and one in Idaho, and we were inspired by the legacies of faith they left behind.</p>
      <p>We began trying to get pregnant again early this year, without success, but are hoping that changes in the next few months. Harper has fully weaned and is so close to standing and walking. She loves to say "dada," "mama," "more," and "baby," and will hug and coo at her stuffed animals. I am set to graduate this December with my bachelor's degree in Information Systems.</p>
